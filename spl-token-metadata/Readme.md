# Choice SPL
Folder for SPL Token MetaData. The goal is to add MetaData to the SPL token. We've defined one [Issue](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/issues/2248) and made a [Request](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/issues/748) for a straightforward path to adding MetaData. Today, we defined another [Issue](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js/issues/295). The roadblock currently is that there is currently no method for adding new metadata to SPL tokens on Solana.
